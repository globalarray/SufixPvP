	 * Constructs a new instance of AsyncTask. Subclasses don't need to call this constructor unless an argument is to be passed. ONLY construct this class from the main thread.
	 * <br>
	 * If an argument is passed into this constructor, it will be stored in a thread-local storage (in ServerScheduler), which MUST be retrieved through {@link #fetchLocal} when {@link #onCompletion} is called.
	 * Otherwise, a NOTICE level message will be raised and the reference will be removed after onCompletion exits.
	 * <br>
	 * If null or no argument is passed, do <em>not</em> call {@link #fetchLocal}, or an exception will be thrown.

	 * WARNING: Use this method carefully. It might take a long time before an AsyncTask is completed. PocketMine will keep a strong reference to objects passed in this method.
	 * This may result in a light memory leak. Usually this does not cause memory failure, but be aware that the object may be no longer usable when the AsyncTask completes.
	 * (E.g. a {@link \pocketmine\Level} object is no longer usable because it is unloaded while the AsyncTask is executing, or even a plugin might be unloaded)
	 * Since PocketMine keeps a strong reference, the objects are still valid, but the implementation is responsible for checking whether these objects are still usable.
